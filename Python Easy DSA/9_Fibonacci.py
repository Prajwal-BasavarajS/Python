# Given an integer n. Write a program to find the nth Fibonacci number.

# F(0)= 0, F(1)=1
# The nth Fibonacci number is given by the forumla F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). The first few fibonacci numbers are: 0 1 1 2 3 5. . . . 

# Examples:

# Input: n = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: In the series 0 1 1 2 3 5...... the fourth fibonacci number is 3.



n = int (input())
